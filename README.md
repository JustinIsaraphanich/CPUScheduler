# CPUScheduler
## This project is a CPU scheduler written in C++ utilizing three basic scheduling algorithims: First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Multi Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ).
## All three of these algorithims have their advantages and disadvantages. The purpose of this program is to highlight each of these comparisons.
